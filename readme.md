This installer uses NSIS, just [download it](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) and then build the installer script `installer.nsi` with NSIS. (make sure to add NSIS to your PATH)
```bash
makensis installer.nsi
```

Prebuilt binary is available on the repo and you can also download it from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eurotrucksimulator2-laneassist/files/latest/download).
